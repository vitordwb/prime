# PRIME - Plataforma Remota para Integração e Monitoramento de Equipamentos

The project aims to overcome limitations in relay-based control systems by offering an innovative solution to enhance connectivity, usability, and web integration. By integrating an internal microcontroller, current sensor, timer, and other advanced functionalities, the module will provide higher operational efficiency and cost reduction. The transition to a web interface will enable real-time remote monitoring, optimizing industrial processes and minimizing unplanned downtime. Thus, the project addresses the growing need for more efficient and modern control solutions.
